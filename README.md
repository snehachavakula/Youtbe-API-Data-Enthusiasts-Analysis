# Youtbe-API-Data-Enthusiasts-Analysis

This is a data analysis project that utilizes the YouTube API to collect data from YouTube channels in the data science niche. The data is then analyzed to provide insights on the channels' performance, such as the number of views, likes, and comments, as well as trends over time.

# Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed, as well as the following libraries:

1. google-auth
2. google-auth-oauthlib
3. google-auth-httplib2
4. google-api-python-client
5. pandas
6. matplotlib
7. seaborn

# Data Analysis

The 'Youtube-API-Analysis.ipynb' notebook contains data analysis and visualization of the data gathered from the YouTube API. The notebook uses Python packages such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. Data cleaning: cleaning the data and enriching the data.
2. Descriptive statistics: calculating and visualizing descriptive statistics of the data.
3. Data visualization: creating visualizations to explore the data.
4. Correlation analysis: analyzing the correlation between different variables in the data.

# Conclusion

This project provides an overview of how to use the YouTube API to gather data on data science YouTubers and their content. The data analysis and visualization can help aspiring data science content creators and enthusiasts understand what makes a successful data science YouTube channel. The project can be extended to include more data and analysis to gain further insights into data science content on YouTube.
